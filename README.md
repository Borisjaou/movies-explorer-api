## The Movies Explorer API project 
is a backend server built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides the backend functionality for the Movies Explorer application, which allows users to search for and save movies.

The project includes several endpoints that allow the client application to interact with the server, including:

* /signup: an endpoint for creating a new user account
* /signin: an endpoint for authenticating a user and generating a JSON Web Token (JWT)
* /users/me: an endpoint for retrieving information about the authenticated user
* /movies: an endpoint for retrieving a list of movies from an external API
* /movies/:movieId: an endpoint for retrieving details about a specific movie
* /movies: an endpoint for saving a movie to the user's list of saved movies
* /movies/:movieId: an endpoint for removing a movie from the user's list of saved movies

The project also includes middleware functions for handling authentication and error handling.

The project is organized using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, with separate folders for models, controllers, routes, and middleware. This makes the codebase easy to navigate and maintain.
